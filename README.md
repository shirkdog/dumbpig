=======
An automated way to check for "dumb" snort rules. (Originally written by Leon Ward)

Requirements
------------
Perl, LWP::Simple, and Parse::Snort.

Setup
-------
On CentOS 6/7, setup is as follows:

On Mac OS with Perlbrew:
Note, don't mess with your system Perl on OSX, it will bite you. Perlbrew is your friend.

```
$ cpanm Parse::Snort
$ ./dumbpig.pl
```

Issue 1
2 Problem(s) found with rule on line 5 of bad.rules

alert ip any any -> any 53  ( \
    msg:"DNS lookup for foo.com using IP proto with port numbers"; \
    content:"baddomain"; \
    sid:1; \
    rev:1; \
)
- IP rule with port number (or var that could be set to a port number). This is BAD and invalid syntax.
  It is likely that this rule head is not functioning as you expect it to.
  The IP protocol doesn't have port numbers.
  If you want to inspect both UDP and TCP traffic on specific ports use two rules, its faster and valid syntax.
- No classification specified - Please add a classtype to add correct priority rating

- No classification specified - Please add a classtype to add correct priority rating
- TCP, without flow. Consider adding flow to provide better state tracking on this TCP based rule
